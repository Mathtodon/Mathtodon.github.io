## [](#header-2) Data Science and Online Courses

While studying for my fourth exam, I also enrolled in a Data Science course with General Assembly where I learned to program in Python and started my interest in Machine Learning.

Since then, I have completed the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree from UDACITY and multiple online courses for SQL and Speed Reading.
