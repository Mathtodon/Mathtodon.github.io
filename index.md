# [](#header-1)About Me

Hello! Thanks for visiting my site! My name is Collin Hazlett and I currently live in NYC. I am originally from Austin, Texas where I grew up and attended the University of Texas. In 2014 I recieved a B.S. in Mathmematics and a B.A. in Economics and am in the process of applying to Graduate Schools.

I have passed 4 actuarial exams: P, FM, MFE, and C

| Exam         | Score      | Date        |
|:-------------|:-----------|:------------|
| P            | 8          | 05/15/2014  |
| FM           | 7          | 10/16/2014  |
| MFE          | 9          | 11/19/2015  |
| C            | 7          | 06/21/2016  |


While studying for my fourth exam, I also enrolled in a Data Science course with General Assembly where I learned to program in Python and started my interest in Machine Learning.

Since then, I have completed the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree from UDACITY and multiple online courses for SQL and Speed Reading.

I love learning and I'm excited about what A.I. and M.L. can offer to the field of Education.
